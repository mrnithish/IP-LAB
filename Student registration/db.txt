Step 3: Database Setup 
• Create a MySQL database and a table named registrations with columns id (auto
increment), first_name, last_name, email, phone, and event. 
 
CREATE DATABASE yourdatabase; 
USE yourdatabase; 
  
CREATE TABLE registrations ( 
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, 
    first_name VARCHAR(255), 
    last_name VARCHAR(255), 
    email VARCHAR(255), 
    phone VARCHAR(20), 
    event VARCHAR(50) 
); 
 
Step 4: Deployment 
• Deploy your application to a Servlet container like Apache Tomcat. 
• Ensure that your database server is running. 
Step 5: Access the Registration Form 
• Open a web browser and navigate to 
http://localhost:8080/yourwebapp/registration.html. 
• Fill out the form and submit the registration. 
This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you'd want to add more validation, 
error handling, and security measures. Additionally, it's recommended to use frameworks 
like Spring for more robust and maintainable applications.
